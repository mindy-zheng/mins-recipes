# mins-recipes

Description: This project will be a foundation for learning HTTP, CSS, Javscript, and getting into the habit of utilizing git. It'll hold all of my favorite recipes in one place, so I can readily access these delicious dishes. It'll be sorted by cuisine, and hopefully be aesthetically pleasing.
