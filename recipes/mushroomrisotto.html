        <h2><u>Description</u></h2> 
        <p>An authentic Italian-style risotto, bursting with flavor and rich creaminess. This can be served as a side dish, a starter, or a main dish. It's a favorite for sure, though it takes long - absolutely worth the patience and care.
        Estimated time: 40 minutes ‚è≥ </p>
        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups of chicken broth, or more</li> 
            <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds of mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of Arborio rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>1/3 cups of freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Seasoning: sea salt, freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add all the mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
