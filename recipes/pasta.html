        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Dried spaghetti</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>   
            <li>2 tablespoons of freshly grounded black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>3 cups of finely grated Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesean</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, filling pot slightly less than normal. (This increases the amount of starch leached from the pasta as it boils.)</li>
            <li>Add pasta and cook, stirring frequently, until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta, transferring 6 cups pasta cooking liquid to a medium saucepan; keep warm. Wipe out pasta pot.         
            </li>
            <li>Cook oil, pepper, and butter in pasta pot over high heat, stirring, until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, 3–4 minutes. Add pasta and 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid and cook over high heat, stirring vigorously to help draw starch from pasta, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat and add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add 3 cups Pecorino Romano in large handfuls, stirring and tossing vigorously with tongs, until very creamy. Stir in Grana Padano, adding more pasta cooking liquid if pasta is dry. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately with more Pecorino Romano on the side.</li>
        </ol>
