        <h2><u>Description</u></h2> 
        <p>Delicious home-made pizza that finishes with a beautifully crispy top and oozing creamy cheese. It's super easy and doesn't take long to make, either! 
        Estimated time: 1-2 hours ⏳
        </p>
        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>1-1 1/2 cups of flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Mozzarella, kept cold</li>
            <li>Toppings: Pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the yeast, sugar and warm water together in a bowl. Put in one cup of flour and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, mix until it comes together, flour your hands and start kneading. Keep adding flour as needed to keep the dough from being sticky, but don't add too much. </li>
            <li>Knead until you can stretch it out thin without it tearing. Form the dough into a smooth ball, coat it and the inside of the bowl with olive oil, cover, and let rise — either for at least 24 hours in the fridge, or 1-2 hours at room temperature.</li>
            <li>In a 10-inch cast iron pan, pour in enough olive oil to coat the bottom well. Put in a little oregano, lots of black pepper and a small pinch of salt. Mix that together with your fingers and spread the seasoned oil around the bottom, corners, and edges of the pan. Grab the risen dough ball and stretch it out a little wider than the pan. Let it proof in the pan for half an hour until puffy.</li>
            <li>Turn burner to medium heat and prep your oven's broiler on high. Spread the sauce onto the dough and spread from edge to edge. Cover the surface with parmesan and mozzarella.</li>
            <li>After 7-8 minutes, put the pan in the burner until the top is brown to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
